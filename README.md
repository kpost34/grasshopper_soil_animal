# **Effects of Grasshoppers on Soil Animal Communities**
Re-analysis of master's thesis using tidyverse packages.

## Introduction
The aim of this project was to assess the impact of grasshopper feeding on assemblages of soil nematodes and microarthropods in the shortgrass steppe of northern Colorado. A short-term field experiment was conducted and data on grasshoppers, plants (above- and belowground), and soil moisture, nematodes, and microarthropods were collected. The data were cleaned and wrangled using tidyverse packages, and analysis included parametric and non-parmaetric tests, multivariate methods, and a mixed-effects model.
